# EloCalculator
This tool is aiming to calculate the variation of Elo between two players playing a match.
The aiming function could be like:
 	elo_compute(rating1, result1, rating2, result2)
 	rating* = range(1000, X, 1)
  	result* = random.randint(0,1) # there should be an update to cope with results = random.randint(0, 5)
Returning values should be an updated version of the ratings
